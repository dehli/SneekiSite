Earlier in the year, Yik Yak started to gain a lot of traction. It's an anonymous, location based, Twitter, and I loved the idea. However, I never got into Twitter, preferring sharing photos through Instagram. With this, Snip Snap was born. I started working on it in July of 2014. After a few weeks of work, I decided a different name was needed. I decided on Sneeki.

It's been a great learning experience, and I'm constantly working on making it even better. When I see people using it, it encourages me to make Sneeki even better.
